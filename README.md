## Introduction

Hoping this will be my first attempt to build and deploy a little app that I can use to track my reading! There's a chance I will commit to this repo once and then completely forget about it forever, but hopefully that won't happen

# Tech 
* Written using python 3.13

# To Do List:

* Add permissions so I cant commit to master - add stuff so can only push once cicd pipeline has passed etc when built
* Build a cicd pipeline
* Create some commit hooks
